# Linked Lists

A linked list is a data structure that is a linear collection of objects(nodes) in non-contigous memory.

## Singly Linked List

- Node object
    - Only contains data and pointer to next node in memory

- Time Complexities
    - Insertion : O(1)
    - Deletion : O(1)
    - Search: O(n)

## Doubly Linked List

- Node object
    - Contains pointer to previous and next nodes
